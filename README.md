[Correcting the record on clowns.](https://www.reddit.com/user/clown_b0t/?sort=top)

## This is a Reddit bot I programmed on a lark. It searches popular subs looking for people using the word "clown" as an insult.

#### When it fetches an appropriate comment it brings a prompt back asking whether it's appropriate to leave a funny reply.

#### Here is the comment the bot leaves if prompted:

Hi! Circus performer here. Just dipping in to clear up this too-frequent comparison between clowns and stupid people:
1. Clowns are very diligent and work very hard at refining their art.
2. Clowns are generally very kind and well-intentioned people.
3. Clowns are only *pretending* they are completely stupid.

For a clownish rabbit hole, please enjoy this play written by Dario Fo, the only clown to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKfwC70YZI
